    "## Introduction\n",
    "***\n",
    "<p>Within this Jupyter notebook, I will discuss the idea of a <b>Heap Sort sorting algorithm</b>, its purpose, and the reason as to why I am exploring this particular field.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structures and Algorithms\n",
    "***\n",
    "<p>Before discussing what a Heap Sort algorithm is, it is important to first know what algorithms are in relevance to the field of Computer Science and Graph Theory. According to the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, an algorithm can be defined as <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science/Algorithms-and-complexity\">\"a specific procedure for solving a well-defined computational problem.\"</a> <sup><a href=\"#references\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Algorithms are what defines how we solve a particular problem and the approach in which we take in order to implement the solution. In this particular context, algorithms are used to define <b>data structures</b> and their operations. <b>Data structures</b> are collections of data that are organised in such a manner which allows for us to efficiently process its contents, as described on the <a href=\"https://isaaccomputerscience.org/concepts/dsa_datastruct_definitions?examBoard=all&stage=all\"><i>Isaac Computer Science</i></a> website.<sup><a href=\"#references\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Algorithms determine the way in which the data is organised and used within these particular structures. Heap Sort is one of the many sorting algorithms in which is used within the field of programming and is considered to be one of the most efficient in accordance to its performance, which is described in Big O notation. I will discuss this notation in another section on the computational complexity of the algorithm.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Well, why are data structures important and why is it a noteworthy point of discussion? The significance of data structures and their algorithms inherently lies in the <u>significance of the data itself</u>. Data is invaluable to us as people, and especially as software developers. Therefore, having an efficient manner in organising and retrieving such data is of utmost importance to us.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Data structures and algorithms are considered to be <a href=\"https://www.synergisticit.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/\">\"interrelated\"</a><sup><a href=\"#references\">[3]</a></sup>. Using the correct data structure, alongside the algorithm in which applies to it can significantly improve performance in all aspects. Any opportunity to increase performance is always an opportunity in which we strive to achieve.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heap\n",
    "***\n",
    "<p>Now that we have briefly discussed what data structures and algorithms, let us begin discussing the Heap Sorting algorithm further.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To understand the exact concept of a Heap Sort, we must first begin by discussing what a Heap is. Described by <i>Goodrich (et all)</i>, Heaps are <b>binary trees</b> (each node has at most 2 children) which satisfy two properties. A <i>relational property</i>, describes the way in which nodes are stored, and a <i>structural property</i>, which defines the shape of the heap itself.<sup><a href=\"#references\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational Property\n",
    "<p>The relational property of a heap can be described as follows:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>The parent node P is greater than or equal to a child node C (Max Heap)</li>\n",
    "  <li>The parent node P is less than or equal to a child node C (Min Heap)</li>\n",
    "</ul> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This guarentees that the node at the top of the tree (root node) is either the smallest element or the largest within the data structure. This allows for efficient sorting and retrieval of data. In implementing the Heap Sort algorithm, a <u>max heap</u> is used, which I will discuss further in the relevant section.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structural Property\n",
    "<p>The structural property in which a binary tree must satisfy is that it must be a <b>complete</b> binary tree. \n",
    "A binary tree of height $h$ is considered complete if all levels up to $h$ has the maximal nodes possible. The final level $h$ may  either have the max amount of nodes, or have the nodes reside in the leftmost possible position of $h$ otherwise.<sup><a href=\"#references\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Within a complete binary tree, the number of internal nodes (nodes which have 1 or more children<sup><a href=\"#references\">[5]</a></sup>) can be showcased by $(n/2)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes within the tree.<sup><a href=\"#references\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n",

    "***\n",
    "<p>Now that we have a better understanding as to what exactly a Heap is, we can begin to explore the algorithm in which implements the Heap data structure, and how, in further detail.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Heapsort can be described as a \"comparison-based\"<sup><a href=\"#references\">[8]</a></sup> sorting algorithm, due to its implementation of the binary heap data structure. The reason that Heap sort can be described as such is due to the relational property in which we touched upon when discussing the properties in which a Heap must satisfy. Given that P is a parent node of C:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Max Heap: $ P >= C$<br>\n",
    "Min Heap: $ P <= C$</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>When implementing the heapsort algorithm, a max heap is generally used.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heapsort: Steps\n",
    "<p>The steps in which are taken when implementing the heapsort can be broken into two main parts. Firstly, the unsorted list is turned into a max heap. Secondly,the algorithm then proceeds to create a sorted array, by continously retrieving the <b>largest element</b> of the heap (being the root node), and inserting it into the array.<sup><a href=\"#references\">[9]</a></sup></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> These two aspects can be broken down into the following steps, which has been outlined by Prof. Srini Devadas in his lecture on Heapsort<sup><a href=\"#references\">[10]</a></sup>, in relation to sorting heap array $L$: </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",

    "    <li>Retrieve the largest element (root node, due to being a max-heap)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Swap the last element of the list ($L(n)$) with the first element ($L(0)$)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Decrease the size of the heap by 1</li>\n",
    "    <li>Due to the new root potentially violating the relational property of the max heap ($P >= C$), we must correct this by sifting the element down the list to its correct positioning (this is commonly called \"max-heapify\")</li>\n",
    "    <li>Repeat from step 2 until the heap is empty</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Max-Heapify\n",
    "<p>What exactly is a \"max-heapify\" and why is it important in the case of the heapsort algorithm? Well, as mentioned earlier, this operation ensures that the max-heap maintains the relational property in which it must satisfy, by moving the newly inserted element into its correct placing.</p>\n",
    "\n",
