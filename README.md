# Graph Theory: Assessment

## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to display the learning outcomes in which I achieved throughout the course of this module.

You will find within this repository:

- Explanation and implementation of the Heap Sort Algorithm
- Conceptualizing and discussing the Graph Isomorphism Problem

This is achieved through the usage of Python, which, as described by its official documentation, is an "interpreted high-level general purpose programming language". Python is extremely popular within the field of data science due to the easy-to-learn syntax and the wide variety of libraries in which are offered ()

Python is then used to create notebooks through a package known as Jupyter, which is an extremely helpful tool in visualizing data in an organised and concise manner. **expand on Jupyter, why it is helpful as an environment**

## Getting Started
**Detail how to prepare the code, how to run the code and what is to be expected when the code is run**
