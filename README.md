# Graph Theory: Assessment

## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to display the learning outcomes in which I achieved throughout the course of this module. Through the process of researching these topics, I gained a deeper insight into topics within the field of computer theory which I feel has improved my ability as a software developer, both in coding and in critical thinking.

You will find within this repository:

- An explanation and implementation of the Heap Sort Algorithm
- The conceptualizing and discusion of the Graph Isomorphism Problem

This is achieved through the usage of Python, which, as described by its official documentation, as an "interpreted high-level general purpose programming language". Python is extremely popular within the field of data science, due to the easy-to-learn syntax and the wide variety of libraries in which are offered.

Python is then used to create notebooks through a package known as Jupyter, which is an extremely helpful tool in visualizing data in an organised and concise manner. The ability to write both markdown and code allows for descriptive and demonstrative documentation to be formed, which gives the option for proper analysis into a given topic.

## Getting Started
To prepare and modify the Jupyter notebooks, the following steps must be taken:

  1. Install `Anaconda` <br>
    - Anaconda is a distribution of Python, used for scientific computing. It provides many of the common libraries and modules associated with statistical work, alongside Jupyter.
  2. Install `Git` <br>
    - Git is a distributed version control system which allows for the management of projects. To clone this repository for use, git must be used
  3. Clone the repository from a terminal <br>
    - A repository can be cloned by copying the link of the repository and entering the following into your preferred terminal: ` git clone [repository url]`
  4. Open the cloned repository location in your terminal
    - Once done, the Jupyter notebooks can be viewed by running the following command in your terminal window: `jupyter notebook`. This will open in your default browser and display the files within your current Jupyter session

## Running the notebooks
If any modifications are made to the notebooks, or there are any errors which occur, the notebooks can be run by the following:

- Navigate to the `Kernel` section in the related notebook
- Select `Restart and Run All`

This will re-run each cell within the notebook, to ensure that all relevant cells are executed.
